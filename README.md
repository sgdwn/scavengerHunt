# Cloudflare Workers Scavenger Hunt  
This is a script designed to be hosted on Cloudflare workers, for scavenger hunts. Placing 4 digit codes around a city or other location, and then adding these to the script, allows participants to obtain points on 'checking in' at these locations.  

To deploy this, copy the code into a blank Cloudflare workers project. Update the check-in codes and points to those you have distributed and allocated, and then click deploy.
